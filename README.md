# Automated Multimodal System For Holistic Answer Sheet Evaluation
A multimodal answer sheet evaluation approach integrating both textual and visual elements. First, evaluation of textual responses is improved using NLP and a fine-tuned large language model Llama 3.2. Second, LightGlue, a neural network-based feature matcher, is incorporated for diagram evaluation, enhanced by a custom image preprocessing pipeline, OCR integration and NLP metrics to improve diagram feature evaluation accuracy and enable precise extraction and analysis of diagram labels.
